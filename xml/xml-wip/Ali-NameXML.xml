(1967) Muhammad Ali, “Black is Best”
April 22, 1967

<p>We are striving today for Freedom, Justice, and equality and as a matter of fact the Whole World is fighting for freedom, justice, and equality.
and I would like for you to know more about my leader and my teacher the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. I'm signing autographs today too and we have newspaper here. Entitled Mohammed Speaks newspapers and theses newspapers are sold for a cheap, cheap, price.
And just 20 cents and you cannot buy the Wisdom, Knowledge, and understanding that's in this newspaper. And I would like to see as many of you as possible who can afford it. Buy one of these papers and I don't care if you buy 4,000 of them i'll be here unitl I sign every paper, everyone.
If you just line up for miles I'll stay here and sin these papers. It's just that important for you and the money. I'm not here for the money as you know I'm averaging around 2 million a year.</p>

<p>You all are not crazy. You're not fools. You're intelligent. This is 1967. People are going to the Moon!
Other countries that were slaves on the masters are  getting independence and if you check it donw get right down to it we don't who we are.
What's your name? If I said it was Mr. Chang Chong, you'd picture a Chinamen. If I said here comes Mr. Khrushchev, you'd look for Russia.
If I said in comes Mr. Goldberg, you look for Jews. If I said in comes Whitecloud you look for Indian. I said in comes Castro, you look for Cuban. Mr Whitecloud Indian.
Here comes Mr. Lumumba, Mr Kenyatta you look for African, a Black man. Now what's your last name? 
If I said in comes Mr. Jones, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Clay, Mr. Culpepper, Mr. Roundtree. You won't know if he's Black or White until you see him alright.</p>

<p>We are 22 Million people who don't have our names. We were named after our slave master, so teaches the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. 
When we were first brought to America. We were robed of all knowledge of ourselves. 
Mentally, we are not free, see, Jesus, said "The Truth shall make you free". The Truth alone, you shall know the truth and that will make you free."
He didn't say setting in, laying in, walking in, forcing in, and integrating in truth. And once you become free, find out who you are, then you'll start saying "I am the Greatest"</p>

<p>We look at Miss American, we see White, we look at Miss World we see white, we look at Miss Universe we see shite. Even Tarzan, the King of the Jungle, in back Africa. We can't got to heaven, we can't go to heaven until wer're washed in lamb blood to it's white as snow.
When we get to heaven we walk on a Milky White Way. We are taught, when we were little children that Mary had a little lamb, his feet as white as snow. 
Then we were talking about snow white.This is not funny, this is serious, it's a fact, a true fact.
White Owl Cigars, White Swan soap, King White Soap,White Cloud Tissue Paper, White rain hairs, White Tornado Flow Wax, White plus two face. 
All the good cowboys around the white horses. The White House, ... Angel food cake is the white cake but the Devil food cake is the Chocolate cake.
You feel better already if you're hearing this for the first time.</p>

<p>"When the White Man came to America, 
He neeeded someone to work the land 
his back was too weak he needed you black man 
so he commissioned 
Sir John Hawkins to commit world's 
most griefest sin that is take a man 
who's born to be free 
and bring him donw to slavery sell a man 
as merchandise 
on his body put a price 
so my friends its easy to tell White Men's Heaven
is a Black Man's Hell"   </p>
