    When we were first brought to America. We were robed of all knowledge of ourselves. 
Mentally, we are not free, see, <person name="god" occupation="god">Jesus</person>, said "The Truth shall make you free. The Truth alone, you shall know the truth and that will make you free."
        He didn't say <act cat="non-violence" subcat="sit-in">sitting in</act>, <act  cat="non-violence" subcat="lay-down">laying in</act>, <act  cat="non-violence" subcat="march">walking in</act>, <act  cat="active-resistance" subcat="force">forcing in</act>, and <act  cat="non-violence" subcat="integration">integrating in</act> truth.

    <p>We look at Miss American, we see <set group="european" type="ethnicity">white</set>, we look at Miss World we see <set group="european" type="ethnicity">white</set>, we look at Miss Universe we see <set group="european" type="ethnicity">white</set>. <cause cat="black_culture">Even Tarzan, the King of the Jungle, in back Africa.</cause>
        We can't got to heaven, we can't go to heaven until wer're washed in lamb blood to it's <set group="european" type="ethnicity">white</set> as snow.
        When we get to heaven we walk on a Milky <set group="european" type="ethnicity">White</set> Way. We are taught, when we were little children that Mary had a little lamb, his fleece as <set group="european" type="ethnicity">white</set> as snow. 
Then we were talking about Snow <set group="european" type="ethnicity">White</set>.This is not funny, this is serious, it's a fact, a true fact.

You feel better already if you're hearing this for the first time.</p>

<p>
"When the <set group="european" type="ethnicity">White</set> man came to America, 
He neeeded someone to work the land 
his back was too weak he needed you <set group="african" type="ethnicity">black man.</set> 
so he commissioned 
Sir <person name="john_hawkins" occupation="slave_trader">John Hawkins</person> to commit world's 
most griefest sin that is take a man 
who's born to be free 
and bring him down to slavery sell a man 
as merchandise 
on his body put a price 
so my friends its easy to tell <set group="european" type="ethnicity">White</set> man's Heaven
is a <set group="african" type="ethnicity">black man</set>'s Hell"
