				<h1>NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE</h1>
				
				<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
				<img id="right" src="crs8.jpeg" alt=""/>
				<p>During the civil rights movement, nonviolent resistance was a powerful strategy employed by groups of activists seeking to bring about social change. This approach involved peacefully protesting and demonstrating against discriminatory laws and practices, while also refusing to comply with unjust regulations. Nonviolent resistance emphasized the importance of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation as means to challenge oppressive structures and systems. Most famously led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who took inspiration by Gandhi, nonviolent resistance took a path of nonviolence and civil disobedience with the belief that action would end inequality and racial discrimination. Nonviolent demonstrators typically did so via sit-ins, boycotts, protests, marches, and more. These activists were faced with cruel pro-segregationists and racists—especially across the south—but the activists of this movement were stronger and persisted through adversity to achieve their goals. &nbsp;&nbsp;

				<h2>DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.</h2>
				<img id="right" src="crs9.jpeg" alt=""/>
				<p>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister, activist, and leader in the civil rights movement. Born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. King became one of the most prominent and influential figures in American history. He is best known for his role in advancing civil rights through nonviolent civil disobedience and his passionate speeches. Dr. King fought tirelessly for racial equality and justice, leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and helping to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama. He was also a key figure in the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the inspiration for numerous movements advocating for peace, justice, and human rights.
