				<h1>HUEY P. NEWTON</h1>
				
				<img id="right" src="../images/huey.jpeg" alt=""/>
				<p>Huey P. Newton was an American activist and revolutionary who co-founded the Black Panther Party with Bobby Seale in 1966. Born in Monroe, Louisiana in 1942, Newton grew up in poverty in Oakland, California. He earned a degree in philosophy from Merritt College and became active in the civil rights movement. As a co-founder of the Black Panther Party, Newton played a key role in developing the party's ideology and organizing its activities. The party was dedicated to protecting Black communities from police brutality and other forms of oppression, and it advocated for the creation of a socialist society based on community control and self-determination.

			    <p>Huey Newton’s speech has half active resistance and half nonviolence mentioned. Newton was a co-founder of the BPP and he was very, very assertive. More so than Hampton. The full name of the BPP was the BPP of self-defense, however Newton’s speech doesn’t have mentions of self-defense. This could be due to the way the person tagged actions mentioned in Newton’s speech, as he is very straightforward and what might come off as violent is rather not meaning to be. Newton’s beliefs about what action the BPP should take reflects his speech as he felt that groups of oppressed Americans should take action into their own hands.

				<h2>SPEECH ON: THE WOMEN'S LIBERATION AND GAY LIBERATION MOVEMENTS</h2>
				<p>In the speech on women's liberation and gay liberation movements, Huey P. Newton addressed the need for the party to be inclusive of all oppressed people, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. He spoke about the ways in which the struggle for Black liberation was intimately connected to the struggles for women's and gay liberation. He argued that these movements were all part of a larger struggle against the oppressive system of capitalism and imperialism, and he called on the party to actively support these movements. &nbsp;&nbsp;
