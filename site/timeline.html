Activism in this time was extremely dangerous as the KKK had soared in membership to over 10,000 members. The police stopped and arrested the 3 men who were driving together adn they were taken to the local prison. After a friend paid their fines, the men were told to leave the county but they were never seen again. The investigation led to the men's bodies being discovered on August 4 of that year. </span>
