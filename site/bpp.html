				<h1>BLACK PANTHER PARTY</h1>
				
				<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
				<img id="right" src="../images/bpanthers-1.jpeg" alt=""/>
				<p>The Black Panther Party was a revolutionary socialist organization that emerged in the United States during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Founded in Oakland, California, in 1966, the party was dedicated to the protection of Black communities from police brutality and other forms of oppression. The party was founded by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton, two college students who were inspired by the ideas of Malcolm X and other black nationalist leaders. The party's philosophy was based on the idea of "revolutionary intercommunalism," which called for the creation of a socialist society based on the principles of community control, self-determination, and solidarity among all oppressed peoples. The party also believed in the right of Black people to defend themselves against police brutality and other forms of violence. The party gained national attention for its community programs, which included free breakfast programs for children, health clinics, and educational initiatives. The party also organized armed patrols of Black neighborhoods to monitor police activity and protect residents from harassment and abuse. &nbsp;&nbsp;
