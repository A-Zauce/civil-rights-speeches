				<h1>MUHAMMAD ALI</h1>
				
				<h2>"BLACK IS BEST"</h2>
				<p>In "Black is Best," Muhammad Ali emphasized the importance of Black pride and unity in the face of discrimination and oppression. He then went on to challenge the notion of white superiority and argued that Black people were just as capable and deserving of success and respect. He called on Black people to embrace their heritage and culture, and to reject the idea that they needed to conform to white standards in order to succeed. Ali also criticized the Vietnam War and the way that Black soldiers were being treated. He argued that Black people were being asked to fight for a country that did not value their lives or rights. He urged Black soldiers to refuse to fight and to instead focus their energy on fighting for their own rights and freedoms at home.
